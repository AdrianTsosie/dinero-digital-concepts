## Milestone 1 Feedback
Great job on your Milestone 1! You clearly put thought into your plan for your PWP and it shows. Your persona could be a little more fleshed out with details, but I understand how it connects to your goals which is the important part. I like that you already have a logo and idea for a business stance for your site. Be careful of scope creep and make sure that you don't plan to do too much in your PWP - I would focus on design and a strong contact form for now.

Your HTML looks great as well! Making sure your indentation is really organized helps catch little things - I think you have an li tag at the bottom that doesn't get closed, but overall your indentation looks good. You don't need some of the extra spaces you have, and you can close your p tags around your text kind of like this example: https://github.com/mjbovee/mjbovee-pwp/blob/master/public_html/documentation/milestone-1.html

Your .gitignore is almost perfectly set up, except that vendor is spelled with an 'o'. :)

Overall you did a good job putting everything together, and your milestone passes at a Tier III. Nice work!
