## Milestone 1 Feedback
Great job on your Milestone 1! You clearly put thought into your plan for your PWP and it shows. Your persona could be a little more fleshed out with details, but I understand how it connects to your goals which is the important part. I like that you already have a logo and idea for a business stance for your site. Be careful of scope creep and make sure that you don't plan to do too much in your PWP - I would focus on design and a strong contact form for now.

Your HTML looks great as well! Making sure your indentation is really organized helps catch little things - I think you have an li tag at the bottom that doesn't get closed, but overall your indentation looks good. You don't need some of the extra spaces you have, and you can close your p tags around your text kind of like this example: https://github.com/mjbovee/mjbovee-pwp/blob/master/public_html/documentation/milestone-1.html

Your .gitignore is almost perfectly set up, except that vendor is spelled with an 'o'. :)

Overall you did a good job putting everything together, and your milestone passes at a Tier III. Nice work!

## Milestone 2a Feedback 
Nice work on these wireframes and accompanying content strategy - your design ideas are clear and well-defined. This will provide you with a good guide for your development phase ahead. One suggestion, I would scrap the search bar due to its functionality and integration. Maybe you could pursue this down the road, but for now I would focus on with other animations you wish to include. Don't forget to change the .gitignore file from /vendor to /vendor! This is crucial when it comes to installing composer packages. Also, just be aware of your spacing throughout the development phase of your site. I only suggest this due to the fact that you have a lot of content.

Additional recommendations/documentation for you:

For displaying your photos at full size when clicked, I would suggest checking out something like FancyBox3. I have provided a link to the JavaScript library that will help you create this animation.  https://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/

Google Fonts - has ~1000 free fonts & easy to integrate https://fonts.google.com/

FontAwesome - quality library with free iconography for use.
https://fontawesome.com/

Animate CSS - this is a library that when used properly can help you achieve some of the CSS animation you mentioned throughout your content strategy

If you're feel taking a reading ahead regarding the contact form integration, here is the documentation:

We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no frontend-facing site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Remember use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory for now!
